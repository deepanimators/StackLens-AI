## ‚ùì **QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION**

1. **AI Performance**: Are you okay with implementing caching that might show slightly older suggestions for similar errors?
2. **File Deletion**: Should we implement soft delete (mark as deleted) or hard delete (permanent removal)?
3. **Reports**: Which export formats are most important (CSV, PDF, Excel)?
4. **Timestamps**: Do you want to maintain Unix timestamps or convert to ISO format?
5. **Security**: Are there any specific compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)?
6. **Deployment**: Are you deploying to a specific cloud provider or on-premises?
7. **Database**: Are you open to database schema changes if needed for performance?
8. **AI API**: Do you have rate limits on your Gemini API key we should be aware of?
9. **File Storage**: Should we implement cloud storage (S3, etc.) or keep local storage?
10. **Monitoring**: Do you want to add application monitoring (logging, metrics) as part of this?
