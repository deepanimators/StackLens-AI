# StackLens Database Integration Analysis & Recommendation

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: Use existing `stacklens.db` instead of creating a separate `error_corpus.db`**

Your existing StackLens database contains a **wealth of real-world error data** that provides superior training material compared to any synthetic corpus. The integrated approach offers significant advantages in accuracy, maintenance, and implementation.
