## 🧠 **GPU Requirements Analysis**

**Yes, you NEED a GPU for optimal performance:**

### **Why GPU is Essential:**

1. **Transformer Models**: 768-dimensional embeddings with 110M+ parameters
2. **Training Speed**: 10-50x faster than CPU
3. **Real-time Inference**: <50ms response time vs 5-10 seconds on CPU
4. **Model Complexity**: Deep neural networks require parallel computation

### **Recommended GPU Setup:**

- **Development**: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
- **Production**: NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM) or H100
- **AWS EC2**: `p3.8xlarge`, `g4dn.xlarge`, or `g5.xlarge`

## 🔧 **How to Run**

### **Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)**

```bash
cd ml_microservices
docker-compose up --build
```

### **Option 2: Local Development**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch all services
chmod +x launch_all_enhanced.sh
./launch_all_enhanced.sh
```

### **Option 3: Individual Services**

```bash
# Deep learning service only
uvicorn deep_learning_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8006
```

## 🎯 **Integration with Your Existing System**

The deep learning models seamlessly integrate with your current architecture:

```typescript
// In your existing ML service
const deepLearningResult = await fetch("http://localhost:8006/predict", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    error_context: {
      message: errorMessage,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      system_state: currentSystemState,
      recent_errors: recentErrorHistory,
    },
  }),
});

const prediction = await deepLearningResult.json();
// Use prediction.predicted_severity, prediction.optimal_suggestions, etc.
```
