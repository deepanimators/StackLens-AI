## 💡 Key Concepts

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
What you need for a working demo:
- Demo POS that creates errors ✓
- StackLens AI that analyzes errors ✓
- Jira integration that creates tickets ✓
- Real-time dashboard showing updates ✓

### Production-Ready
What you need for real deployment:
- Error handling and retries
- Database transactions
- Rate limiting
- Security (API keys, encryption)
- Monitoring and logging
- Load testing

### Demo Success
What stakeholders want to see:
1. Error happens (fast)
2. System detects it (automatic)
3. AI understands it (intelligent)
4. Ticket created (automated)
5. Updates show (real-time)
