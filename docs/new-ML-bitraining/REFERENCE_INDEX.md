**Self-Questioning (Phase 1):**
- Data efficiency: 100 samples → 40% performance
- Cross-domain: Only 4.3% performance drop
- Synthetic vs real: Within 5% of each other

**Self-Navigating (Phase 2):**
- Experience injection: +5.4% immediate
- Implicit learning: +7.9% after training
- Optimal ratio: η=0.5 (50% vanilla, 50% guided)

**Self-Attributing (Phase 3):**
- Convergence speed: 50% faster (90→40 steps)
- Final accuracy: +4% improvement
- Data efficiency: 55% fewer steps needed

**Combined:**
- Qwen2.5-7B: +186% improvement (15.8%→45.2%)
- Qwen2.5-14B: +93% improvement (29.8%→57.6%)

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR TEAM

After reading the analysis:

1. **Can we implement a user feedback mechanism?** (CRITICAL - no learning without this)
2. **Do we have GPU resources?** (1x T4 minimum for Phase 1)
3. **Is 18-24 month commitment realistic?** (Phased, not quick win)
4. **What's the business value of +15-20% accuracy?** (Highest in Phase 3)
5. **Should we start Phase 1 proof-of-concept?** (3-4 months, low risk)
6. **Who will lead Phase 1?** (Architect + 1-2 engineers)
7. **What's our current accuracy baseline?** (Need for Phase 1 comparison)
8. **Can we prototype synthetic log generation?** (Phase 1 MVP)
9. **Do we have vector DB infrastructure?** (Needed for Phase 2)
10. **What's the success metric for Phase 1?** (Should exceed current by 2%)

A: YES - All three mechanisms directly address gaps. +15-20% projected accuracy improvement over 18-24 months.

**Q: What do we need?**
A: Feedback mechanism (CRITICAL), GPU resources, team commitment, 18-24 months.

**Q: When should we start?**
A: Phase 1 (3-4 months, low risk) can start immediately after this analysis is approved.

**Q: What's the business case?**
A: $60K+ annual savings Phase 1 alone, +20% accuracy improvement Phase 3. ROI: 18-24 months.
